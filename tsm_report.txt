  the number of tapes required for storage based upon 102400 MB/tape.

6. Database and Log Space


    The Database and Recovery log always need extra room in order to operate.
  If they get full the server will crash. If these get over 90% utilization
  then you need to extend them.

7. Volume Information


    This section lists any that are unusual or have special status. This is
  largely for your information, the server will deal with most of these during
  normal operation.

  audited:         an 'AUDIT VOLUME' command was issued and the system has verified the data on this volume.
  random audit:    these volumes will be auditted using 'AUDIT VOLUME'.
  reclaimable:     tapes with more than 25% reclaimable space.  These should be reclaimed daily.

8. Storage Pools

    Storage pools are where all the data ends up. Pay particular attention to
  the storage pools with a device class of "DISK" as well as the percentage
  utilization.

9. Scratch Volumes


    Scratch volumes are the volumes that TSM uses to do... well pretty much
  everything. If you run out then the server will break and bad juju will
  happen. All of the numbers below should be greater than at least 10.

10. Active Processes, Requests, and Sessions

    If there are a large number of process or requests then you probably need
  to have a look to see why. This might be normal; check the messages carefully
  to make sure.

12. DRM Plan File


    Disaster recovery plan files are generated by the server every night. They
  should be up to date. The latest one found will be at in this directory:
